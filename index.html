<a name="sklar-home-page" class="anchor" href="#sklar-home-page"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>SKLAR HOME PAGE</h1>

<h2>
<a name="purpose" class="anchor" href="#purpose"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Purpose</h2>

<ul>
<li>The design of the site should be guided by the content; the content should be guided by our goals for funneling visitors into customers</li>
<li>Current site doesn't drive anyone in any particular direction; we need <em>focus</em>
</li>
<li>If we're aiming to have the best product search in the industry then we should promote the search more</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="loading-time" class="anchor" href="#loading-time"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Loading Time</h2>

<ul>
<li>For perspective, there has been--for 20 years now--an established understanding of user reaction vis-a-vis web loading times. </li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p>These rules of thumb were originally based on 1950s research, first delineated in Jakob Nielson's 1993 book Usability Engineering[1], later reconfirmed in 2010 by Nielson[2], and currently held as a core principle by Google[3]:</p>

<ul>
<li>0.1 seconds gives the feeling of instantaneous response. This level of responsiveness supports the feeling of direct manipulation (which increases engagement and control).</li>
<li>1 second keeps the user's flow of thought seamless. Users can sense a delay, but still feel in control of the overall experience.</li>
<li>10 seconds keeps the user's attention. For 1-10 seconds, users feel at the mercy of the computer and wish it was faster, but they can handle it.</li>
<li>After 10 seconds they start thinking about other things, making it harder to get their brains back on track once the computer finally does respond. A 10-second delay will often make users leave a site immediately. Even if they stay, it's harder for them to understand what's going on, making it less likely that they'll succeed in any difficult task.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Page speed analyzation tools criticize us for having too many http request (i.e. the page loads too many external files from our server)

<ul>
<li>We can alleviate this problem easily:

<ul>
<li>Social Media icons can be stored as a sprite map or as base64 encoded inline text [read: a simple change can reduce 5-6 http requests]</li>
<li>Our home page currently makes 45 http requests every time it's loaded. All said and done we can reduce our http requests to <em>15</em> without sacrificing any functionality</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We can (and should) use source code pre-processors for our CSS and other static text assets. Pre-processors will check our CSS for errors and output an optimized (smaller file size) CSS file</li>
<li>We can (and should) load our javascript framework JQuery from Google's servers instead of hosting the code ourself. Google's copy of the code is identical, will likely load faster, and will likely already be cached in the user's browser.</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="layout" class="anchor" href="#layout"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Layout</h2>

<ul>
<li>We can make our phone number easy to find without having it above the fold. Having our phone number at the very top means that someone looking for the number can get it without seeing anything else on the page. Walmart puts the toys in the back of the store because they know that kids will drag their parents to the toy section thus forcing the parents to see more products as they walk to the back of the store. </li>
<li>Navigation Links

<ul>
<li>People are confused by Customer Service vs. About Us vs. Contact Us</li>
<li>Careers probably shouldn't be listed with the other primary navigation links. Is the main goal of our site to attract customers or to attract employees? Remember: the site needs goal-oriented focus. We can have a Careers link in our footer next to the other contact information and/or on an About Us page.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Social Media Links

<ul>
<li>Having our site and social media outlets interlink with one another is good for search enginge positioning</li>
<li>Having social media links that float on the page, block content, and make the site difficult to use on mobile is <em>not</em> the way to go about it. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We should really think about whether or not we want to use an image carousel on the front page. Their effectiveness is questionable[4][5][6].</li>
<li>No one sees the Surgical Instruments and Care &amp; Cleaning images on the right of the home page

<ul>
<li>People read in an F pattern (left-to-right, top-to-bottom) and their eyes will only reach those images if they're interested enough in the carousel to continue looking right</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The design of "Browse Products By" on the home page is confusing because it has the same styling as the search filters even though they're fundamentally different: search filters constrain and reduce the content that you're already looking at; "Browse Products By" introduces you to new content</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="updating" class="anchor" href="#updating"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Updating</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>"If you're thinking about for people, then frequency might be a nice thing to have...But whenever you're thinking about the search engines it's much, much, <em>much</em> more important to think about the quality of your content. For example, on my blog, I don't post every day. Sometimes I don't post every week...If you need to take three weeks to do some research and then that research results in a really good blog post...So don't just pay attention to 'I have to have a certain frequency of updates'...If you're thinking about search engines, what's much more important is the quality of the content rather than the frequency with which it's posted." -- <strong><em>Matt Cutts, Head of Google's Webspam Team</em></strong> [7]</p>

<p>“Google's chief resource for fighting spam, Matt Cutts, has said that Penguin focused on penalizing sites that use black-hat techniques and rewarding sites that are offering a great visitor experience.“ [8]</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>Updating often is a good thing; becoming fixated on frequency of updating is <em>not</em>. Google is constantly tweaking their ranking algorithm with the goal of promoting the sites that have the best content and best user experience. Traditional SEO techniques don't need to be ignored, but if we focus on quality content and user experience then Google is likely to notice.</p></li>
<li><p>We should probably be using heatmap testing[9] and A/B testing[10] to get feedback on user experience and interaction</p></li>
